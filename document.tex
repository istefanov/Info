%\section*{Objective}
% I am applying for the position of LDBC Community manager. The LDBC project is
% of particular interest to me, since I have worked on creating an RDF
% benchmark \cite{bowlognaBench} and I have done evaluations with several other
% benchmarks \cite{nosqlrdf}. I have experienced the need for more unified
% standards in the field of RDF and Graph databases, where most solutions are
% very specific and datasets vary widely in their structure so a
% cross comparison is difficult. Realizing the seriousness of the issue
% I'd be happy to help others in the field and spread the word of a
% possible solution.

% After finishing my Master studies I took up the opportunity to
% work for a little while in the academic world, focusing on the Semantic Web and
% Linked Data. Now I am looking for a challenging long-term assignment, where I
% can pursue my interests in Software Engineering, Linked Data and Distributed
% Database Systems,
